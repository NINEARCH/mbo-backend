# MBO

MBO (Made by order) system that allows people to order food and queue in application instead of paper
in **local restaurants**.  


## No more "moo-krob mhod lau ja"  when you just arrived at the restaurant
MBO will show the restaurant **ingredient's stock** in the app to make sure you can eat moo-krob today!
otherwise, when moo-krob is out of stock you can choose another menu before going to a restaurant 

## Hey Aunt! You skip my order AGAIN!

How bad about ordering food and then waiting for a long long time? but the restaurant skipped my dish! Ahhh!
Don't worry we have a solution, just order on the MBO application, then your order will show in the queue on the MBO merchant app. event an ingredient is just out of stock on your queue, the Restaurant will notify you to change to another menu instead


## 
**Another feature**
More features will come in the future 
for example 
- I don't know what to eat, just random it!
- Can i order before going to a restaurant?
- Can i order another menu in a restaurant nearby?
